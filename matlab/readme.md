See the [Quest Documentation](https://kb.northwestern.edu/quest-matlab) for information on setting up a parallel profile in MATLAB to use cores from multiple nodes.  The examples here assume that you have an appropriate parallel profile set up for the `_multinode` examples.  You will need to edit the .m files in the multinode examples to use a parallel profile that you already have established.

All of the examples were developed with MATLAB r2016a, but they should be simple enough that the version doesn't make a difference.
