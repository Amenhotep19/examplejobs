# Example Quest Jobs

This repository contains example job submission and application scripts for use on Quest.

In all cases, you need to update the information in the scripts as appropriate to your allocation, the computing resources you need, and your files/directories.  

See [Quest Documentation](https://kb.northwestern.edu/page.php?id=72406) for more information.  This repository is a supplement to that documentation.
